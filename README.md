# Systronix_PCA9557
Arduino library for the I2C 8-bit I/O register PCA9557
Specifically we are using this to drive some legacy custom hardware, through multiple RS485 interfaces (one per signal).
## TODO 
split this into a base library and an app library so there is no '595 and '165 interface specific code in the base library.
